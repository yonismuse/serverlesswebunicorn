<h1>Deploying a Serverless Web Application in AWS</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/pKTK4QN8fXY)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of deploying a serverless web application on AWS using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Cognito. The project is based on AWS's tutorial and so for more info I would check out this link: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/.

<h2>Terminate Resources</h2>
Remember to delete everything you have created. I probably will live my demo up for a couple of days but will delete after because the services are in the Free Tier but for safe measure delete them.
